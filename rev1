Program that simulates the heating and cooling of water

#Start date May 26, 2016

#Part 1 models the heating of the body and the appoximate time it takes for the body of water to heat

rho_g = 1 #density of water in g/cm^3

rho_kg = 1000 #density of water in kg/m^3

c = 4.184 #specifc heat of water in J / g-C

power_rating = float(input('Input the combined power rating of the heating element(s) in Watts: '))

water_volume = float(input('Input the volume of water in liters: '))
temp_initial = float(input('Input the intial temperature of the water in Celsius: '))
temp_final = float(input('Input the desired temperture setting in Celsius: '))
mass_water = 1000 * water_volume * rho_g #factor of 1000 used to convert the density from cm^3 to liters
Q = mass_water * c * (temp_final - temp_initial) #calculates the amount of energy(J) neccesary to achieve temperature change
time = Q / power_rating #; used to find the time(s) that the water takes to heat
print('It takes %s seconds to heat the water.' % time)
#print( 'The time to reach ' + str(temp_final) + ' degrees Celsius is ' + str(time/60) + ' minutes') #time in mins


#Part  2 will model the cooling of the body
#current_temp = room_temp + (temp_final - room_temp)e^(-kt) #Newton's Law of Cooling describes how the water will cool
